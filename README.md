# 🌫️ AQI Prediction using Machine Learning  
**🏆 2nd Place - Inventum Hackathon (College Tech Fest)**

This project focuses on predicting the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** using machine learning models trained on environmental data. Built during our college hackathon, **Inventum**, the project demonstrates end-to-end data science workflows—from data preprocessing to deployment using a user-friendly web interface.

## 📌 Overview

Air pollution is one of the leading causes of health hazards in urban areas. This project aims to provide a **predictive model for AQI** based on pollutant concentrations (like PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, etc.) and weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.).
